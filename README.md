# About Me

Hello World! My name is _Bruno Meneguello_. I'm a software developer (sometimes engineer, sometimes analyst) working with software since the 2000s, having worked with many technologies in those years.

My hobbies are running, reading, and cooking, which I try to practice every day, but not simultaneously.

This page is a work in progress. As soon as I have time it will be updated.
